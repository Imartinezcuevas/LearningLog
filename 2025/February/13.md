# What I learned today:
## API Proyect
### Uvicorn
Uvicorn is an ASGI (asynchronous server gateway interface) server that runs web applicattions efficiently and quickly.

#### Uvicorn internal process
1. Receives an HTTP request from the client.
2. Converts the request to an ASGI event.
3. Call the FastAPI app to process it.
4. Collects the response and sends it to the client.

#### Uvicorn essential commands 
* **Run a FastAPI app** ->  `uvicorn main:app --reload`
    * main:app -> main.py is the file, app is the instance of FastAPI.
    * --reload -> Enables automatic reloading code changes are made (development only).
* **Speficy port and address** -> `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000`
* **Run with multiple workers (production)** -> `gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker main:app`
    * -w 4 -> Start 4 processes to handle more requests.
    * -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -> User Uvicorn inside Gunicorn.
* **Debugging** -> `uvicorn main:app --reload --log-level debug`
* **Run in the background** -> `nohup uvicorn main:app &`

### DataBase
FastAPI has no built-in database, so I'm going to use SQLite to start (We could change to PostgreSQL or MySQL later on).

SQLite is a lightweight embedded database engine. Unlike PostgreSQL or MySQL, we don't need a server. The .db file is the database.
* It's perfect for development and test.
* Fast for small apps.
* Supports standard SQL.

SQLAlchemy is an ORM (object-relational mapper). It allows us to interact with the database using Python instead of SQL.
* Cleaner code (we work with objects instead of SQL).
* Avoid SQL Injection. 
* Compatible with many databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).

#### What is a data model?
A data model is a Python representation of a table in the database. In SQLAlchemy ORM, each data model is defined as a Python class.
It allow us to access tables as objects. For example:
```python
Users = Base.classes.users # Table "users"
Tasks = Base.classes.tasks # Table "tasks"
```
