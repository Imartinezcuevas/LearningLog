# What I learned today:

## DSA
* Array
    * Access: O(n)
    * Insertion: O(n)
    * Deletion: O(log n) if sorted

* Dinamic arrays
    * Access: O(1)
    * Insertion: O(1) | O(n) if insertion in the middle since shifting will be required
    * Deletion: O(1) | O(n) if deletion in the middle since shifting will be required

* TreeMap
    * Access: O(log n)
    * Insertion: O(log n)
    * Deletion: O(log n)

The downside of hashmaps is that they are not ordered, so its not possible to traverse the keys of a hashmap in any particular order. Because they don't allow duplicates and have key-value pairs, we can use them to count frequency of keys. **When questions use the words "unique", "count" or "frequency", it is almost certain a hashmap or hashset will be usefull for solving the problem.**

* HashMap
    * Access: O(1)
    * Insertion: O(1)
    * Deletion: O(1)
