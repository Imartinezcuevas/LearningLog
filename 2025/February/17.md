### The N-queens problem
Implement an evolutionary representation algorithm with permutations in Python to solve the N-queens problem. Compare the two following schemes, for N = 64:
- AE1: Proportional selection, stochastic sampling with replacement, substitution complete generation.
- AE2: Selection by exponential ranking (c = 0.3), stochastic sampling with replacement, complete generational replacement.

Instead of an NxN matrix, we will use a more compact representation:

* An individual is a permutation of the numbers [0,1,2,…,N−1] .
* The position on the list represents the queen's column.
* The value in that position represents the row the queen is on.
Example for N = 4:

Suppose an individual is represented as: [1,3,2,0] 
This means that:

* The queen in column 0 is in row 1.
* The queen in column 1 is in row 3.
* … 
This representation automatically ensures that there are no conflicts in columns and rows, since each number appears only once. The only thing we need to evaluate are the diagonal conflicts.

How do we evaluate diagonal conflicts?

Two queens at positions (i,x) and (j,y) are on the same diagonal if: |i−j|=|x−y|
```python
class Individuo:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.tablero = np.random.permutation(n)  # Permutación aleatoria
        self.N = n
        self.f = 0

    def fitness(self):
        """
        Calcula el número de conflictos diagonales en el tablero.
        """
        conflictos = 0
        for i in range(self.N):
            for j in range(i + 1, self.N):
                if abs(self.tablero[i] - self.tablero[j]) == abs(j - i):  # Misma diagonal
                    conflictos += 1
        self.f = conflictos  # Guardamos el fitness
        return conflictos

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"N-Reinas({self.tablero.tolist()}) Fitness: {self.fitness()}"

    def __lt__(self, ind):
        return self.f < ind.f
```

For this problem we are asked to try two selection methods.

* Proportional selection (roulette):
    - It is used for minimization, so the fitness is inverted with C - f (where C is the worst fitness + a small constant)
    - Dividing by the total sum of those values ​​is normalized.
    - Roulette more frequently selects individuals with lower fitness.
* Selection by Exponential Ranking:
    - The population is ordered by fitness.
    - Cumulative probabilities are assigned with an exponential decay controlled by c.

```python
def calculate_cumulative_probabilities_proportional(P):
    """
    Calcula las probabilidades acumuladas para selección proporcional.
    Se usa una transformación lineal para minimizar el fitness.
    """
    N = len(P)
    cumulative_probabilities = np.zeros(N)
    C = max(P, key=lambda ind: ind.f).f + 1e-6  # Para transformación lineal
    sum_fitness = sum(C - I.f for I in P)  # C - f para minimizar
    cumulative_probabilities[0] = (C - P[0].f) / sum_fitness
    for i in range(1, N):
        cumulative_probabilities[i] = cumulative_probabilities[i - 1] + (C - P[i].f) / sum_fitness
    return cumulative_probabilities

def calculate_cumulative_probabilities_exponential(P, c=0.3):
    """
    Calcula las probabilidades acumuladas para selección por ranking exponencial.
    """
    N = len(P)
    cumulative_probabilities = np.zeros(N)
    den = c**N - 1
    cumulative_probabilities[0] = (c - 1) / den
    for i in range(1, N):
        cumulative_probabilities[i] = cumulative_probabilities[i - 1] + (c - 1) * c**i / den
    return cumulative_probabilities

def selection(P, cumulative_probabilities):
    """
    Realiza la selección usando muestreo estocástico con reemplazo.
    """
    r = np.random.random()
    i = 0
    while cumulative_probabilities[i] < r:
        i += 1
    return P[i]
```

Since we are using permutations, we are going to use Partially Mapped Crossover (PMX).

The goal is to ensure that the numbers in a child's permutations are consistent with those of the parent, even when transferred between positions. The idea is to prevent a number from appearing more than once in the child, even if the positions change.

Steps:

1. A random segment is chosen.
2. The segment elements are passed directly to the child.
3. Elements outside the segment are "mapped" between the parents to ensure that the number is not repeated.
Example:

If we have:

* Parent 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
* Parent 2: [8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

And we select the segment of indices 2 to 5 of Parent 1:

* Parent 1 (selected segment). [3, 4, 5, 6]
We directly transfer the segment to the child:

* Child: [_, _, 3, 4, 5, 6, _, _]

Now, the elements outside the segment in Parent 1 are mapped to the corresponding positions in Parent 2:

* At number 8 in position 1 of Parent 2 is placed in the first empty position of the child.
* … 

The implementation used has been obtained from the "DEAP" framework. Here the link to the implementation. https://github.com/DEAP/deap/blob/master/deap/tools/crossover.py#L93

In the case of N-queens, the mutation must maintain valid permutations, that is, there cannot be duplicate values ​​in an individual. Furthermore, the mutation must be something that alters the position of the queens, but does not affect the validity of the solution.

For this case, a swap mutation, which consists of selecting two random positions and swapping the values ​​in those positions, is perfect.

```python
def mutacion(individuo, ratio):
    size = individuo.N
    if random.random() < ratio:
        # Elegir dos índices aleatorios para hacer el intercambio
        idx1, idx2 = random.sample(range(size), 2)  # Devuelve dos índices diferentes
        # Intercambiar los elementos en los índices seleccionados
        individuo.tablero[idx1], individuo.tablero[idx2] = individuo.tablero[idx2], individuo.tablero[idx1]

    return individuo
```

## API Proyect
We already have the datbase tests, the next logical step is user authentication. Passwords are NOT saved in plain text. We will use `bcrypt` to encryp them.

`bcrypt` is a library that implements the blowfish algorithm for password hashing. This algorithm has a salting and cost factor mechanism, which makes passwords more difficult of crack using brute force attacks.

### What is Calting?
Salting is the process of adding random data to a password before hashing it. This prevents two identical passwords from generating the same hash.

### What is Cost Factor?
Cost factor determines how many time the hasing algorithm is applied. It is a measure of computational difficulty that makes the process slower, making brute force attacks more difficult.
* `bcrypt` uses an exponential cost factor. (2^n iterations).
* A cost factor of 12 means 4096 iterations.
* A cost factor of 14 means 16384 iterations.

### Main functions
1. `bcrypt.gensalt()` -> Generate a random salt
2. `bcrypt.hashpw(password, salt)` -> Hash a password
3. `bcrypt.checkpw(password, hased_password)` -> Verify a password


Knowing all this, we are going to go to the utils file to create a password and verify it.
```python
def hash_password(password: str) -> str:
    salt = bcrypt.gensalt()
    return bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), salt).decode('utf-8')

def verify_password(password: str, hashed_password: str) -> bool:
    return bcrypt.checkpw(password.encode('utf-8'), hashed_password.encode('utf-8'))
```

Now we can create an endpoint to register users:
```python
@router.post("/register/")
def register(user: UserCreate, db:Session = Depends(get_db)):
    # Verify if the user already exists
    existing_user = db.query(User).filter(User.email = user.email).first()
    if existing_user:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="The user already exists.")

    # Now we add the new user
    new_user = User(email=user.email, password=hash_password(user.password))
    db.add(new_user)
    db.commit()
    db.refres(new_user)
    return {"message": "User register correctly"}
```

The next step is to configure JWT ([12 February](https://github.com/Imartinezcuevas/LearningLog/blob/main/2025/February/12.md)) for the login. In utils we create two functions:
* create_jwt: creates jwt token
* decode_jwt: decotes jwt token

```python
def create_jwt(data: dict, expires_delta: timedelta = timedelta(hours=1)):
    to_encode = data.copy()
    expire = datetime.utcnow() + expires_delta
    to_encode.update({"exp": expire})
    return jwt.encode(to_encode, SECRET_KEY, algorithm=ALGORITHM)

def decode_jwt(token: str):
    try:
        return jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])
    except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
        return None
    except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
        return None
```

Then we can create an endpoint in a similar way to what we have done with the registry.

### Unit testing
Lastly, we are going to write the tests for the registration and login endpoints using `pytest`. The objectives are:
* Test that a user can register correctly.
* Verify that a user can log in with correct credentials.
* Block access with incorrect credentials.

```python
def test_register_user():
    response = client.post("auth/register", json=test_user)
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert response.json()["email"] == test_user.email

def test_login_correct():
    response = client.post("auth/login", json=test_user)
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert "access_token" in response.json()

def test_login_incorrect():
    wrong_user = {"email": "testuser@example.com", "password": "wrongpassword"}
    response = client.post("auth/login", json=wrong_user)
    assert response.status_code == 401
    assert "access_token" not in response.json()
```
