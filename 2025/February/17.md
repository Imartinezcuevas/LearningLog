### The N-queens problem
Implement an evolutionary representation algorithm with permutations in Python to solve the N-queens problem. Compare the two following schemes, for N = 64:
- AE1: Proportional selection, stochastic sampling with replacement, substitution complete generation.
- AE2: Selection by exponential ranking (c = 0.3), stochastic sampling with replacement, complete generational replacement.

Instead of an NxN matrix, we will use a more compact representation:

* An individual is a permutation of the numbers [0,1,2,…,N−1] .
* The position on the list represents the queen's column.
* The value in that position represents the row the queen is on.
Example for N = 4:

Suppose an individual is represented as: [1,3,2,0] 
This means that:

* The queen in column 0 is in row 1.
* The queen in column 1 is in row 3.
* … 
This representation automatically ensures that there are no conflicts in columns and rows, since each number appears only once. The only thing we need to evaluate are the diagonal conflicts.

How do we evaluate diagonal conflicts?

Two queens at positions (i,x) and (j,y) are on the same diagonal if: |i−j|=|x−y|
```python
class Individuo:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.tablero = np.random.permutation(n)  # Permutación aleatoria
        self.N = n
        self.f = 0

    def fitness(self):
        """
        Calcula el número de conflictos diagonales en el tablero.
        """
        conflictos = 0
        for i in range(self.N):
            for j in range(i + 1, self.N):
                if abs(self.tablero[i] - self.tablero[j]) == abs(j - i):  # Misma diagonal
                    conflictos += 1
        self.f = conflictos  # Guardamos el fitness
        return conflictos

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"N-Reinas({self.tablero.tolist()}) Fitness: {self.fitness()}"

    def __lt__(self, ind):
        return self.f < ind.f
```

For this problem we are asked to try two selection methods.

* Proportional selection (roulette):
    - It is used for minimization, so the fitness is inverted with C - f (where C is the worst fitness + a small constant)
    - Dividing by the total sum of those values ​​is normalized.
    - Roulette more frequently selects individuals with lower fitness.
* Selection by Exponential Ranking:
    - The population is ordered by fitness.
    - Cumulative probabilities are assigned with an exponential decay controlled by c.

```python
def calculate_cumulative_probabilities_proportional(P):
    """
    Calcula las probabilidades acumuladas para selección proporcional.
    Se usa una transformación lineal para minimizar el fitness.
    """
    N = len(P)
    cumulative_probabilities = np.zeros(N)
    C = max(P, key=lambda ind: ind.f).f + 1e-6  # Para transformación lineal
    sum_fitness = sum(C - I.f for I in P)  # C - f para minimizar
    cumulative_probabilities[0] = (C - P[0].f) / sum_fitness
    for i in range(1, N):
        cumulative_probabilities[i] = cumulative_probabilities[i - 1] + (C - P[i].f) / sum_fitness
    return cumulative_probabilities

def calculate_cumulative_probabilities_exponential(P, c=0.3):
    """
    Calcula las probabilidades acumuladas para selección por ranking exponencial.
    """
    N = len(P)
    cumulative_probabilities = np.zeros(N)
    den = c**N - 1
    cumulative_probabilities[0] = (c - 1) / den
    for i in range(1, N):
        cumulative_probabilities[i] = cumulative_probabilities[i - 1] + (c - 1) * c**i / den
    return cumulative_probabilities

def selection(P, cumulative_probabilities):
    """
    Realiza la selección usando muestreo estocástico con reemplazo.
    """
    r = np.random.random()
    i = 0
    while cumulative_probabilities[i] < r:
        i += 1
    return P[i]
```

Since we are using permutations, we are going to use Partially Mapped Crossover (PMX).

The goal is to ensure that the numbers in a child's permutations are consistent with those of the parent, even when transferred between positions. The idea is to prevent a number from appearing more than once in the child, even if the positions change.

Steps:

1. A random segment is chosen.
2. The segment elements are passed directly to the child.
3. Elements outside the segment are "mapped" between the parents to ensure that the number is not repeated.
Example:

If we have:

* Parent 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
* Parent 2: [8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

And we select the segment of indices 2 to 5 of Parent 1:

* Parent 1 (selected segment). [3, 4, 5, 6]
We directly transfer the segment to the child:

* Child: [_, _, 3, 4, 5, 6, _, _]

Now, the elements outside the segment in Parent 1 are mapped to the corresponding positions in Parent 2:

* At number 8 in position 1 of Parent 2 is placed in the first empty position of the child.
* … 

The implementation used has been obtained from the "DEAP" framework. Here the link to the implementation. https://github.com/DEAP/deap/blob/master/deap/tools/crossover.py#L93

In the case of N-queens, the mutation must maintain valid permutations, that is, there cannot be duplicate values ​​in an individual. Furthermore, the mutation must be something that alters the position of the queens, but does not affect the validity of the solution.

For this case, a swap mutation, which consists of selecting two random positions and swapping the values ​​in those positions, is perfect.

```python
def mutacion(individuo, ratio):
    size = individuo.N
    if random.random() < ratio:
        # Elegir dos índices aleatorios para hacer el intercambio
        idx1, idx2 = random.sample(range(size), 2)  # Devuelve dos índices diferentes
        # Intercambiar los elementos en los índices seleccionados
        individuo.tablero[idx1], individuo.tablero[idx2] = individuo.tablero[idx2], individuo.tablero[idx1]

    return individuo
```
