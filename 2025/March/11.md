## Explainable machine learning

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a technique in the field of explainable machine learning used to understand and break down the impact of each feature (input) on a model's prediction. Essentially, SHAP helps explain the outpu of complex models in a way that is understandable to humans, like black-box models.

The core idea of SHAP is to use Shapley values from game theory. Shapley values come form cooperative game theory and are used to faily distribute the "value" that each player contributes to the final outcome of the game. SHAP applies this cancept to calculate how much each feature contributes to a model's prediction. 

When a model makes a prediction, for example, predicting a value or a classification, SHAP helps you understand this in the following way:
1. Each feature (input) is compared with other possible combinations of features to see its impact on the prediction.
2. The Shapley value for a specific feature is the average contribution it makes to the prediction, considering all possible combinations of features.

For example, let's say we have a model that predicts house prices based on features like the number of rooms, square footage, location, etc. SHAP will help you understand how important each of these features was in the model's final prediction.

### How does SHAP work in simple terms?
Imagine we have a team of players (the input features), and the "value" that each player contributes to the final result of the game (the prediction). Shapley values are calculated by considering all the possible combinations in which players can join the game and how much each player contributes to winning in each combination.

For example:
* If we have a model with three features ($x_1, x_2, x_3$) and want to understand how $x_1$ influences the final prediction, SHAP will consider all possible combinations of $x_1, x_2 and x_3$, calculating the impact of each feature in each combination. The Shapley value for $x_1$ will be the average of all these contributions.

### How are SHAP values calculated?

The calculation of Shapley values is computationally expensive because it involves evaluating the model over many possible combinations of features, which can be inefficient for complex models with many features. Howeer, there are efficient approximations, such as TreeSHAP (for decision trees), that optimize this calculation.

#### Simple example
Let's say you have a model that predicts the price of a house with 3 features:
* $X_1$: Size of the house
* $X_2$: Number of rooms
* $X_3$: Age of the house

An the model predicts that the price of a house is €100000. We want to understand how each feature contributes to this prediction.

**Step 1: Evaluate the impact of $X_1$**

Let's assume we start with the empty subset $S=\empty$ (no features). The initial prediction is 90000€.
Now, we calculate how each feature changes the prediction and we add them:

    Case 1: Empty set (no features, baseline prediction)
    * If we don’t use any feature at all:
        $f({})=90,000€$

    Case 2: Adding only $X_1$
    * If we only use Size:
        $f({X_1})=95,000€$
    Contribution of $X_1$ here: 95,000 - 90,000 = 5,000€

    Case 3: Adding only $X_2$
    * If we only use Number of rooms:
        $f({X_2 })=93,000€$

    Case 4: Adding both $X_1$ and $X_2$
    * If we use Size + Number of rooms:
        $f({X_1, X_2})=98,000€$
    Contribution of $X_1$ here: 98,000 - 93,000 = 5,000€

    Case 5: Adding only $X_3$
    * If we only use Age:
        $f({X_3 })=92,000€$

    Case 6: Adding $X_1$ and $X_3$
    * If we use Size + Age:
        $f({X_1, X_3 })=97,000€$
    Contribution of $X_1$ here: 97,000 - 92,000 = 5,000€

    **Case 7: Adding all three features (X_1, X_2, X_3)**
    * If we use Size + Rooms + Age:
        $f({X_1, X_2, X_3})=100,000€$

    Contribution of $X_1$ here: 100,000 - 95,000 = 5,000€

**Step 2: Calculate the Shapley value of $X_1$**
We now take the average of all the contributions of $X_1$ in all cases:

$$(5000+5000+5000+5000)/4 = 5000$$
So, the Shapley value for Size ($X_1$) is €5,000, meaning that, on average, Size contributes €5,000 to the model's house price prediction.
